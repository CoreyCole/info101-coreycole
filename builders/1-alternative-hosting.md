# Alternative Hosting on GitHub
The gClass builder assignment "Establishing a Web Site" directs you to the UW service Vergil for hosting your files. Vergil is an awesome service provided by the UW, but it has some drawbacks. An alternative solution is provided by GitHub: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a centralized location where people store [open sourced](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) code. It's a hub were people collaborate on ideas both big and small. 

## Why should I make a GitHub account?
GitHub a great tool to share your projects with others (be it job recruiters, friends, family, etc.). The Web Site you built for Info 101 today is a great start to your portfolio! Also, if you go on to take more Informatics classes, participate in hackathons, or work on independent projects, GitHub is great tool to use!

## What is Git?
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control). It is a bit out of scope for this builder, but essentially it facilitates multiple people all working on the same code at once.

# Builder Requirements (What to do)
### After you have uploaded your Web Site to vergil, try to upload to GitHub Pages (instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/))
#### Follow the "User or Organization site" option, summarized below:
  - Make a GitHub Account
  - Decide how you want to use it (terminal or desktop client)
  - Make a repository using your GitHub username (named username.github.io)
  - Clone that repository to your computer
  - Copy your Web Site files into that folder you cloned to your computer
  - Commit the files you added and sync with GitHub!
  - You're done! Fire up a browser and go to http://username.github.io
