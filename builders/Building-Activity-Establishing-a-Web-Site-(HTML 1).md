# Building Activity-Establishing a Web Site (HTML 1)  (65 min.)
## Establishing a Web Site

In this activity you will learn how to create a simple Web site and upload it to Github's free hosting service. Github provides web servers for free for 1 website. People commonly use this as a personal home page or portfolio site.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a centralized location where people store [open sourced](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) code. It's a hub were people collaborate on ideas both big and small. 

## Why should I make a GitHub account?
GitHub a great tool to share your projects with others (be it job recruiters, friends, family, etc.). The Web Site you built for Info 101 today is a great start to your portfolio! Also, if you go on to take more Informatics classes, participate in hackathons, or work on independent projects, GitHub is great tool to use!

## What is Git?
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control). It is a bit out of scope for this builder, but essentially it facilitates multiple people all working on the same code at once.

# To Do
## To complete this builder, you will have to do the following:
1) Create a Github account with the username `studentId-studentNumber`
    - for example, Corey's student id is `coreylc` and his student number is `1338578` so his Github username is `coreylc-1338578`
2) Make a hello world page
3) Display the file locally on your computer
4) Upload your file to Github's web servers
5) (optional) Make enhancements

## 1) Get set up with a Github account and repository
1) Go [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) to sign up for a Github account
2) Sign up with the username `studentId-studentNumber`
    - *IMPORTANT:* make sure to sign up with the correct account name so we can sync your assignments with gClass
3) Create a repository named `username.github.io` (this would be `studentId-studentNumber.github.io` if you set up your account correctly)

## 2) Make a hello world page
1) Download the Github desktop client [here](https://desktop.github.com/)
2) Use the client to `clone` the repository you made in step 1.3
3) Create an `index.html` file inside the folder you cloned
4) Open the `index.html` file in your HTML editor and type in the text EXACTLY as you see it in the image below.

![hello world html code](http://winhost6.ischool.uw.edu/gclass/files/activities/act_build_html1/helloworld.jpg "hello world html code")

## 3) Display the file locally
You don't need the internet or a Web server to see your pages. You can display them locally. Locally means right on your computer. You can drag the files from their folder and drop them on a browser, load them from the browser, or double-click them in their folder to open them in the browser.

Open your helloWorld page locally in a browser To make sure it displays its message.

## 4) Upload your file to Github's web server
1) Using the Github desktop client, commit and sync your changes
    - You should see an added `index.html` file
2) In your web browser, navigate to `username.github.io`
3) You're done! Click the verify button at the top of the page to certify that the link to your site works.

## 5) Make enhancements (optional)
In the time you have left in this activity, see how many enhancements you can make to your pages. Search the Web for HTML tags and see if you can add some to your page, upload the page again to Github and display the results.
