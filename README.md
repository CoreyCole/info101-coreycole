# Corey Cole's INFO 101 Custom Track
This github repository is for Corey's students in INFO 101. Because of the experimental nature of the class, Bob encourages new ideas for how we can push INFO 101 to its limits. These tasks are entirely optional to the ones posted in gClass. That being said, the INFO 101 staff would love for you to try these alternative builders and give feedback!

## How to use this GitHub page
What you're currently reading is the main README file of the repository. This is the entrypoint for anyone interested in the files hosted here. I'll be putting direct links to the builder activities in this file for quick access.
