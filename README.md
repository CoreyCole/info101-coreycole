# Corey's Info 101 Custom Track
This github repository is for students in Info 101. Because of the experimental nature of the class, Bob encourages new ideas for how we can push Info 101 to its limits. These tasks are entirely optional to the ones posted in gClass. That being said, the Info 101 staff would love for you to try these alternatives and give feedback!
